# Noddy BitTorrent

A low-level BitTorrent client MVP built from scratch in Node.js without external BitTorrent libraries.

This project implements core parts of the BitTorrent ecosystem including custom bencode parsing, HTTP/UDP tracker communication, peer wire protocol handling, and SHA1 piece verification. The goal of the project is to deeply understand networking protocols, binary data handling, and event-driven system design by building the protocol stack manually.

The implementation progresses protocol-layer by protocol-layer:

- HTTP communication in Node.js
- UDP socket programming
- `.torrent` metadata parsing
- Tracker communication
- Peer discovery
- BitTorrent handshake negotiation
- Piece/block downloading and verification

## Download Lifecycle

### 1. Torrent Parsing

The client reads the `.torrent` file, validates the bencode structure,
extracts the raw `info` dictionary bytes, and computes the SHA1 info-hash
used for tracker and peer identification.

### 2. Tracker Communication

The client builds BitTorrent announce requests and communicates with
trackers using both HTTP and UDP tracker protocols. Tracker responses
are validated, decoded, and normalized into a unified peer representation
used by the transport layer.

### 3. Peer Discovery

Peers returned by trackers are parsed from compact and non-compact formats,
supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 peer addresses. The discovery layer also
handles peer deduplication before peers are passed to the connection stage.

### 4. TCP Peer Connection

Peers returned by the tracker are contacted sequentially. The client
attempts to establish a TCP connection and applies timeout handling
to avoid hanging on unreachable peers.

### 5. BitTorrent Handshake

After establishing a TCP connection, the client performs the BitTorrent
handshake by exchanging protocol identifiers, reserved bytes, info-hashes,
and peer IDs. The received info-hash is validated to ensure both peers
are communicating about the same torrent.

### 6. Bitfield Negotiation

Peers advertise available pieces using `BITFIELD` and `HAVE` messages.
The client analyzes peer piece availability to determine which pieces
can be requested from the remote peer.

### 7. Interested / Unchoke Flow

Once a valid downloadable piece is identified, the client sends an
`INTERESTED` message to the peer. Block requests are only sent after
the remote peer responds with an `UNCHOKE` message.

### 8. Block Downloading

After receiving an `UNCHOKE` message, the client requests fixed-size
blocks from the selected piece. Incoming TCP data is buffered and parsed
incrementally to handle fragmented peer-wire messages correctly.

### 9. SHA1 Piece Verification

After all blocks for a piece are downloaded, the client computes the
SHA1 hash of the reconstructed piece buffer and compares it against the
expected hash stored inside the torrent metadata. This guarantees piece
integrity and prevents corrupted or malicious data from being accepted.

## Key Engineering Challenges

### Incremental TCP Stream Parsing

Peer-wire messages may arrive fragmented across multiple TCP packets.
The transport layer buffers incoming data incrementally and only parses
messages once sufficient bytes have been received.

### Handling Unreliable Peers

Many peers returned by trackers are unreachable, timeout, or terminate
connections unexpectedly. The client implements retry and timeout handling
to survive unreliable distributed network behavior.

### Protocol Validation

Tracker responses, handshakes, and peer-wire messages are validated
defensively to prevent malformed protocol data from propagating through
higher layers of the application.

### Asynchronous State Coordination

The project heavily relies on event-driven architecture and asynchronous
network communication. Coordinating peer states, timeouts, retries,
downloads, and CLI rendering required careful separation of concerns.

### Terminal Rendering Synchronization

The CLI dashboard evolved into a state-driven renderer responsible for
displaying peer lifecycle updates, progress visualization, and integrity
verification while avoiding terminal corruption caused by concurrent writes.

## Design Philosophy

This project prioritizes protocol correctness, observability,
and architectural clarity over download throughput or feature
completeness.

The primary focus of the MVP is understanding how the BitTorrent
ecosystem works internally by implementing networking layers manually
instead of relying on existing BitTorrent libraries.

---

## Current Limitations

This project is currently an MVP focused on protocol correctness,
networking fundamentals, and understanding the BitTorrent ecosystem
internally rather than maximizing download throughput.

Current limitations include:

- Sequential peer connection attempts
- Single-piece downloading
- No rarest-first piece selection strategy
- No request pipelining
- No upload/seeding support
- No persistent file writing to disk
- No magnet link support
- No DHT (Distributed Hash Table) support
- No Peer Exchange (PEX)
- Limited peer state management
- CLI currently optimized for debugging/demo usage

These tradeoffs were intentionally made to simplify debugging and
validate protocol behavior incrementally while building the client
layer-by-layer.
